# AngularClass IfShow
Angular 1.x directive that uses ng-if then ng-show afterwards. You would normally use ng-if for perf reasons if you have a lot of bindings and ng-show for dom perf. This allows you to get the benefits of both as `ac-if-show="hasValue"` 

## Installing
`npm install ac-if-show`
or
`bower install acIfShow`
